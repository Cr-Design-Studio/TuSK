# Skripting

**What are skripts?**
Skripts are scripts that let you make bots in Discord. Its written in TuSK, you can learn to write in TuSK [here](https://github.com/TutlaMC/TuSK/blob/main/docs/home.md).

**How to manage your scripts**
Before you create your first script, you'll first want to understand how to manage it. All scripts that will run will be in the `scripts` directory (the scripts directory will be where you installed it- `your_directory/tusk/scripts/`). \

Putting "--" before a script will ignore it (disable it), but you'll still have to remove its associated data with `/remove_associated_data`.You can enable it back again by removing the -- but you'll have to compile it again on your own with `/compile`. This process can be simplified with the Script Panel

## The Script Panel

The script panel lets you manage your scripts within Discord! All you have to do is set your bot up and run `/scripts` and get started!

In the menu you will be able to see, add/remove, enable/disable & compile scripts. All you have to do is click buttons!
